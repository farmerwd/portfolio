# My portfolio
 It's been a long time coming - but I'm finally getting around to setting up a portfolio. Working within a large corporation has kept my work under wraps, but I can't wait on them to figure out the legal process any longer. 

 The goals of this portfolio are thus:
 * Establish a presence that reflects my experience level as a lead now
 * Speak to the outcomes and processes that I've impacted with my work
 * Avoid directly revealing specific information sensitive in nature to the company.
 * Brand it up!
